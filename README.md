# msc_cython_benchmarks

This repository stores benchmarks used in my MSc Thesis to benchmark the HPy backend for Cython I created during the degree (the backend can be found here: https://github.com/DuToitSpies/cython/tree/hpy_backend). The fibonacci, float, and fannkuch benchmarks are adapted from pyperformance, and the forloop benchmark was created during the course of the project.
